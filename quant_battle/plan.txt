Possible system design:

1: 
    -get data
    -split up according to PERMNO(company)
    -put different dfs into seperate parquet files
    -run machine learning model on each files data
2: 
    -get data
    -split up according to PERMNO(company)
    -loop through PERMNOS and run learning model each time
   gg
-go from month to month keeping track of different variables, and our p&l    
-filter main file by sorting by date
-search from the earliest date then put all the data on each company in a dictionary that keeps track of all the variables for each individual permno, check each permno on the month to see if we should make any move

-check if stock is in the dict, if not add it, if yes then add data
-while adding data check to see if it is buy, sell, or hold
-after adding all data check each signal list and act on it

-for thing in sell, check if already in positions. If yes sell all and then an extra. If no sell 1
-for thing in buy, check if positions is positive. If yes buy 1. If negative buy 1- positions
